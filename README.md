This project represents the first website I created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
This site displays the most important information and details you need to know about universities from various parts of the world. The site brings together approximately 45 of the most famous universities in the world, it displays the details of each university, including its location, its specializations, and everything necessary for anyone who wishes to study there.
* Attached is a video of the final appearance of the site:
