  <h1>Edinburgh University</h1>
  
  <p>The University of Edinburgh (abbreviated as Edin. in post-nominals), founded in 1582, is the sixth oldest university in the English-speaking world and one of Scotland's ancient universities. The university has five main campuses in the city of Edinburgh, with many of the buildings in the historic Old Town belonging to the university. The university played an important role in leading Edinburgh to its reputation as a chief intellectual centre during the Age of Enlightenment, and helped give the city the nickname of the Athens of the North.</br></br>The University of Edinburgh is ranked 20th in the world by the 2020 QS World University Rankings. It is ranked as the 6th best university in Europe by the U.S. News' Best Global Universities Ranking, and 7th best in Europe by the Times Higher Education Ranking. The Research Excellence Framework, a research ranking used by the UK government to determine future research funding, ranked Edinburgh (joint submission with Heriot-Watt) 4th in the UK for research power, and 11th overall. It is ranked the 48th most employable university in the world by the 2020 Global Employability University Ranking. It is a member of both the Russell Group, and the League of European Research Universities, a consortium of 21 research universities in Europe. It has the third largest endowment of any university in the United Kingdom, after the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. The annual income of the institution for 2018–19 was £1,080.6 million of which £285.7 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £1,211.9 million.</br></br>Alumni of the university include some of the major figures of modern history, including 3 signatories of the American declaration of independence and 9 heads of state and government (including 3 Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom). As of March 2019, Edinburgh's alumni, faculty members and researchers include 19 Nobel laureates, 3 Turing Award laureates, 1 Fields Medalist, 1 Abel Prize winner, 2 Pulitzer Prize winners, 2 currently sitting UK Supreme Court Justices, and several Olympic gold medallists. It continues to have links to the British Royal Family, having had the Duke of Edinburgh as its Chancellor from 1953 to 2010 and Princess Anne since 2011.</br></br>Edinburgh receives approximately 60,000 applications every year, making it the second most popular university in the UK by volume of applications. It has the 4th-highest average UCAS entry tariff in Scotland, and 8th overall in the UK.</p>

  <h1>What you need to apply</h1>

  <p>To apply to Edinburgh you’ll need qualifications, a personal statement and a reference.
  <h2>Your qualifications</h2>

<p>you will need to provide evidence of your school or college grades and/or predicted grades on your UCAS application. You will also need to provide evidence of your English language skills.</br></br>The qualifications you will need vary by degree and may also depend on whether you are a widening access student.</br></br>You should take the time to understand the entry requirements for the degree you wish to apply for and what qualifications you will need to achieve to be eligible for an offer.</p>

<h2>Your predicted grades</h2>
<p>We use predicted grades as part of our selection procedures. It is therefore very important that your application includes predicted grades for any qualifications that you have listed on your application but have not yet completed.</br>

It is your responsibility to make sure that your referee adds these predicted grades to your application when adding your reference.</p>

</br>
<h2>Your personal statement</h2>
<p>Depending on the degree you are applying for, admissions staff will be looking for different things from your personal statement. Generally, however, your personal statement should:</br></br>

1explain why you want to study the subject you have applied for</br>
2-demonstrate a clear understanding of what the subject involves at degree level</br>
3-detail your relevant skills, qualities and experience and state how these have been developed</br>
4-show that you understand the implications of your choice on your career aspirations</br></br>
If you are applying to a professional or vocational degree you should demonstrate a clear understanding of the profession. If you can, you should support this with evidence of appropriate work experience, volunteering or work shadowing.</br></br>

We recognise that not all students have equal access to such opportunities and therefore do not stipulate that you must achieve experience through any specific means. We will consider a variety of experiences provided you are able to reflect on what you have learned.</br></br>

You can find guidance on personal statements on the UCAS website.</p>
