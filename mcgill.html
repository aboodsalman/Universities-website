The following outlines the minimum requirements for admission to graduate studies at McGill. These minimum requirements apply to both Canadian and international candidates. Please review the list carefully, as you must meet all of the minimum requirements in order to be considered for acceptance.

<h2>Minimum requirements:</h2>
<p>-A Bachelor's degree (or equivalent as recognized by McGill University) in a subject closely related to the one selected for graduate work.
